## Shipping more with less

We reviewed Expedition's codebase and identified a number of issues that we presented along with background information and severity assessments for prioritization.

We built prototype implementations for a number of advanced features in Expedition's system. We were able to deliver clean and concise code thanks to the capabilities of Elixir and Phoenix.

## Growing into the future

Beyond our foundational work, we armed Expedition’s team with further information to enable them to confidently build upon what we’d established. We gave them strategies for tackling their core issues so they could address problems before they turned into roadblocks.
